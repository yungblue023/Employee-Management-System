## 3. Risk Management

### 3.1 Technical Risks

#### High Priority Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| MongoDB connection issues | High | Medium | Use local MongoDB as backup, implement fallback |
| API integration problems | High | Low | Thorough testing, mock data for development |
| React TypeScript complexity | Medium | Low | Use proven patterns, extensive documentation |
| Performance issues | Medium | Medium | Regular performance testing, optimization |

#### Medium Priority Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Browser compatibility | Medium | Low | Test on major browsers, use standard APIs |

| Data validation edge cases | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive test scenarios |

### 3.2 Timeline Risks

#### Schedule Mitigation
- **Buffer Time**: 1 day buffer built into schedule
- **Parallel Development**: Frontend and backend can be developed in parallel after Day 2
- **MVP Approach**: Focus on core features first, enhancements later
- **Daily Reviews**: Daily progress reviews to catch issues early

#### Contingency Plans
- **Scope Reduction**: Remove non-essential features if behind schedule
- **Extended Hours**: Additional development time if needed
- **Simplified UI**: Focus on functionality over advanced styling if time-constrained
