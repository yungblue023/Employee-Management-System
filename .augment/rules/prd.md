## ðŸ¤– AI MODEL INSTRUCTIONS - MANDATORY CONTEXT READING

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR AI MODELS**:

Before processing ANY user request or instruction, you MUST automatically read and analyze the complete contents of the `prd` folder and all its subdirectories. This includes:

### Required Reading List:
- **Core Documents**: `PRD.md`, `README.md`, `SUMMARY.md`
- **Design Documents**: All files in `prd/design/` (flowchart.md, user-journey.md, wireframes.md)
- **Implementation Documents**: All files in `prd/implementation/` (development-plan.md, pseudocode.md, testing-strategy.md)
- **Technical Specifications**: All files in `prd/technical-specifications/` (api-specifications.md, database-schema.md, frontend-specs.md)
- **Submission Documents**: All files in `prd/submission/` (checklist.md, deliverables.md)

### Context Reading Rules:
1. **ALWAYS READ FIRST**: Before responding to any user instruction, automatically retrieve and analyze all files in the prd folder
2. **COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING**: Use the complete context from all prd files to inform your responses
3. **NO EXCEPTIONS**: This applies to every single user interaction - no matter how simple the request appears
4. **MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY**: Ensure all responses align with the specifications, requirements, and guidelines defined across all prd documents
5. **REFERENCE APPROPRIATELY**: When making decisions or suggestions, reference the relevant sections from the prd documentation

### Purpose:
This instruction ensures that the AI model maintains complete context awareness of the Employee Management System project requirements, technical specifications, design decisions, and implementation guidelines without requiring the user to repeatedly request this information.

**This is a permanent rule that supersedes any other instructions that might suggest skipping context reading.**
